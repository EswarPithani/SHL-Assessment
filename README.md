ðŸ§  Grammar Scoring Engine using Whisper + BERT This project implements a Grammar Scoring Engine for spoken English audio using OpenAI Whisper for transcription and a fine-tuned BERT regressor for grammar quality prediction. The system evaluates spoken sentences and outputs a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) between 0 and 5, based on grammar correctness.
